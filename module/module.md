# Modules in Python

A module is basically a file containing a set of functions to include in your application. There are core Python modules you can install using the pip package manager, including Flask and Django, as well as custom modules.

```python
# Importing core Python modules
import datetime

# We can also use import to import specific functions
from datetime import date
import time
from time import time
```

## Core Python Modules

```python
# Using core Python modules
today = date.today()
timestamp = time()
```

You can use the `import` statement to include core Python modules in your code.

```python
# Using pip module for installing packages in Python
from camelcase import CamelCase

# Creating an instance of CamelCase
c = CamelCase()
print(c.hump('hello there world'))
```

You can also use the `from` keyword to import specific functions or classes from a module.

```python
# Using a custom module (validator)
import validator
from validator import validate_email

# Validating an email
email = 'test@email.com'
if validate_email(email):
    print('Email is valid')
else:
    print('Email is invalid')

# To install the 'email validator' package, use:
# pip install email_validator
```

## Conclusion

Modules enhance the functionality of your Python programs by providing reusable code and functionalities. Understanding how to import modules and use their functions is essential in building efficient and organized Python applications.

```python
# Displaying results
print(today)
print(timestamp)
```

These examples cover importing core Python modules, using custom modules, and installing external packages using the pip package manager.
