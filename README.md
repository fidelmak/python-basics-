# Installing Python and Getting Started

## Mac OS

### Step 1: Check if Python is Installed
Open Terminal and type:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If Python is not installed, go to Step 2.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew (Package Manager)
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 3: Install Python
Run:
```bash
brew install python
```

## Windows

### Step 1: Download Python Installer
Go to [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version.

### Step 2: Run Installer
Run the downloaded installer. Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Open Command Prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```

## Linux

### Step 1: Check Python Version
Open Terminal and type:
```bash
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, go to Step 2.

### Step 2: Install Python
For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems, run:
```bash
sudo yum install python3
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Type:
```bash
python3 --version
```

# Getting Started

## Open a Python Interpreter
- Mac/Linux: Open Terminal and type `python3`.
- Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `python`.

## Write Your First Python Program
Create a file, e.g., `hello.py`, with the following content:
```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Save the file and run it in the terminal:
```bash
python hello.py
```

Congratulations! You've installed Python and written your first program. Happy coding!
