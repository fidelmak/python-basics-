# Basics of Python

## Introduction
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager like `conda`.

### Your First Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Core Concepts
### Variables and Data Types
```python
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

### Control Flow
#### Conditional Statements
```python
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

#### Loops
```python
for item in iterable:
    # code block

while condition:
    # code block
```

### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

### Data Structures
#### Lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

#### Dictionaries
```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
```

## Advanced Topics
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
```

### File Handling
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Exception Handling
```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # handle the exception
```
