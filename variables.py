"""
#x = 1        # int
#y = 2.5        # float
#name = 'john'  # str
#is_cool = True #bool
#print(x , y, name)

# multiple assignment 
x , y, name, is_cool = (1,2.5,'john',True)

#print(x , y, name)

# Basic math 
a = x + y

# Casting 
x = str(x)
y = int(y)
z = float(y)
print(type(z),z)

# create a veriable A B and C
# asign a number to it 
# get the sum of A and B 
# assign a variable to the sum
# get the remainder of the division of B and C
# assign a variable to the remainder 
# multiply the sum(A$B) with the remainder(B$C)
# assign a variable to the multiplication
# print the type of the multiplication
